# Paper.IO

This is a clone of the original Paper-IO released by Voodoo, except for one aspect. This will attempt to implement a multi-player aspect of the game (like a real IO game). Currently this has a playground at this [link] (https://thekidofarcrania.github.io/PaperIO-Web). It's a demo version of what to come. Hopefully by that time, the necessary server infrastructure could be obtained.

This is just a fun side-project for me. If you would want to use this code, it would be nice to let me know.

## Running

After cloning this repository, run the follow commands to install dependencies and set up server. Enjoy!

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
